            "subtitle": "<p>Ayurveda (n) is India's 5,000+ year old system of traditional medicine. Ayurvedic (adj) references Ayurveda.<\/p><p>When we say we formulate using Ayurvedic principles, we mean:<\/p><ul><li><strong>We üíú personalized formulas for your unique skin and hair<\/strong>. Ayurveda is all about treating you as an individual. That's why many of our products are available in different formulas for different skin types - personalization is everything!<\/li><li><strong>Our products are gentle<\/strong>. Ayurveda tells us that harsh ingredients are not a good idea. That's why our facial washes and shampoos leave you feeling fresh + clean but never stripped. It's also why <a href=\"\/pages\/no-go-list\" title=\"Ingredients\">we refuse to use many popular conventional ingredients<\/a> that are known to cause irritation.<\/li><li><strong>Our products balance your skin's natural oil production<\/strong>. Ayurveda tells us that oil is king. Your skin and hair need balanced oil production to be their happiest + healthiest. Our products help oily skin types regulate their natural oil production, help combo skin find balance, and provide lasting nourishment for dry skin.<\/li><li><strong>Our products promote circulation of blood and lymph<\/strong>. Ayurveda tells us that the health of the skin are directly related to the health of the circulatory and lymphatic systems. That's why we use many ingredients that boost healthy circulation at skin's surface.<\/li><li><strong>We use powerful herbs native to India.<\/strong> Ayurveda has long used herbs to promote balance in the body. That's why you'll find many unique herbal ingredients in our formulas.<\/li><\/ul><p>Since we also use and love safe synthetic ingredients, our formulas aren't traditional, but they do borrow from the Ayurvedic tradition.<\/p>"

They have a lot of direct-to-consumer resources and also work to change public policy when it comes to personal care products, agriculture, clean air and water, and more.<br\/><br\/>Here's the thing: they're not perfect. They do their fair share of fear mongering.

The fewer the ingredients, the better.\"<\/li><li>\"Look for chemical-free products.\"<\/li><li>\"Synthetic ingredients are bad.\"<\/li><\/ul><p>But here's the thing. All that ‚¨ÜÔ∏è is bullsh*t. It's fear mongering that relies on bad science. So many brands use these kinds of tactics to try to sell you their products.<br\/><br\/>This ain't that.<br\/><br\/>We know that pronounceability is a piss poor proxy for safety. Unless you're a formulator, why would you know every ingredient in your products? Number of ingredients is neutral. EVERYTHING IS A CHEMICAL. And synthetic isn't a four-letter word.<br\/><br\/>Instead, we look at the what, why, and how of each ingredient:<\/p><ul><li>What does this ingredient do?<\/li><li>What is its safety rating?<\/li><li>What are the alternatives?<\/li><li>Why are we using it in this formula?<\/li><li>How does this ingredient work on hair and skin, at the cellular level?<\/li><li>How does it play with other ingredients?<\/li><\/ul><p>Our focus is on education, <em>never<\/em> on fear.<br\/><br\/>Plus, with the pandemic, so many brands outed themselves as anti-science anti-vaxxers.

End of sentence.<br\/><br\/>Some people ask how we can make nontoxic products and be pro-vaxx. It's very simple:<\/p><ul><li>The benefit of vaccines massively outweighs the risks. Prevention of deadly and\/or debilitating disease &gt; the small risk of an adverse event.<\/li><li>The benefit of a potentially harmful cosmetic ingredient almost never outweighs the risk. A slightly different product \"feel\" &lt; your health.<\/li><li>The science around vaccines is settled, and vaccines are easy to study.<\/li><li>The science around cosmetic ingredients is far from settled, and the effects of long-term exposure is very difficult to study.<\/li><\/ul>"
